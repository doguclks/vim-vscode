# My Custom VSCode Vim Keybindings

Welcome! ðŸŽ‰  
This repository contains my personal **VSCode Vim keybindings**, designed to enhance your workflow by combining the power of **Vim motions** with practical **leader key shortcuts** (using `Space` as Leader).

If you're a Vim user who loves working in VSCode but misses those snappy terminal and editor shortcuts â€” you're in the right place.

## ðŸ›  Installation Guide

1. Open **Command Palette** in VSCode:  
   Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and type:  
   **`Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)`**  
   This will open your `keybindings.json` file.

2. Replace or append the contents of your `keybindings.json` with the keybindings from this repository.

3. Save the file and you're ready to go! ðŸš€
